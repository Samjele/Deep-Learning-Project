Report in Triage_classification_project.pdf

Dataset 1: In Triage Folder, Training and test model, triage.ipynb and triage_processed.ipynb. Dataset can be found on kaggle link in our report.
Dataset 2: In yolov7-main, train.py and test.py. Weights in /runs/train/exp/weights.
Our CNN model on Dataset 2: ECG_images_CNN folder, dataset can be found on kaggle link in our report, model trained on ECG_CNN.ipynb


CNN model and weights saved in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZRF8TwlCTwuGSnxXmDZ5f_FMTvAar2n/view?usp=share_link (ECG-model.pth), add the file to ecg_cnn folder and run the notebook.
